OPERATION ASVAB

Overview

OPERATION ASVAB is a dynamic and interactive 10-question test designed to reflect the 10 sections of the U.S. ASVAB. This project aims to provide fun, engaging, and challenging practice questions for candidates preparing for the ASVAB, helping them gauge their knowledge and readiness.

Features

Question Categories: 

The test questions are categorized into three difficulty levels: 

Easy (33 questions)

Medium (33 questions)

Hard (33 questions)

Dynamic Difficulty Progression: 

Candidates begin at the easy level.

A correct answer moves the candidate to the medium level.

If a candidate gets two questions wrong, there is a hard drop back to the lower level.

Question Generation: 

The system generates 99 example questions in each of the 10 sections for comprehensive practice.

Performance Tracking: 

At the end of the test, candidates will receive a breakdown of: 

The number of questions they got right at each difficulty level.

An estimated percentile score to show how they compare to others.

Sections Covered

The test includes practice questions for the following ASVAB sections:

Word Knowledge (WK)

Paragraph Comprehension (PC)

Arithmetic Reasoning (AR)

Mathematics Knowledge (MK)

General Science (GS)

Mechanical Comprehension (MC)

Electronics Information (EI)

Auto Information (AI)

Shop Information (SI)

Assembling Objects (AO)

How It Works

Start the Test: 

The candidate begins answering questions at the easy level.

Dynamic Level Adjustment: 

Answer correctly to advance to the next difficulty level.

Answer two questions wrong to be dropped back to the previous difficulty.

Completion and Results: 

Once completed, the test provides a performance summary including: 

The number of questions answered correctly at each difficulty.

An estimated percentile based on overall performance.

Example Workflow

A candidate starts with easy questions.

After answering correctly: 

Progresses to medium level.

Incorrect answers trigger a hard drop back to the easy or medium level depending on their progress.

Results include the total number of questions answered correctly in easy, medium, and hard categories.

Goal

The purpose of OPERATION ASVAB is to create an engaging way for high school and college candidates to practice ASVAB sections and to discover their percentile.
